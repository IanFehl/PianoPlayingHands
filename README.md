This repository contains all of the source code, calculations, datasheets, notes, sketches, diagrams, parts, flowcharts, and anything else related to our Spring 2019 ECE-3334-302 Computer Engineering Project Lab project. The project is called Piano Playing Hands. The goal of the project is to create an automated piano that is played with mechanical hands that move laterally along a rail. The music is inputted into a computer, and the information needed to play each song is communicated to a microcontroller that will drive the rails for each and fingers on each hand, respectively.
